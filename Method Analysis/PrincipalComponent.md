Principal Component Notes:
- Known as Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Dimensionality reduction algorithm
- Can be used as a tool for visualization, noise filtering, and feature extraction

General Idea:
- You take something with a tremendous amount of dimensions and reduce it to a smaller amount of dimensions to describe the problem better
- Using eigenvectors and eigenvalues you describe the data in terms of the 3 most optimal eigenvectors
	- There are x many eigenvectors/eigenvalues for an x dimensional set
- Supposed you start with 64 dimensions (8x8 pixel picture)... You can choose to dimensionally reduce this to 2 dimensions using PCA
	- The result will be a 2D cluster plot that one can analyze to notice certain things
