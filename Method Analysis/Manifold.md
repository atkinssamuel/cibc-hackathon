Manifold:

Idea:
- unsupervised estimators that seeks to describe datasets as low-dimensional manifolds embedded in high-dimensional spaces.

Notes 
  3 Main types:
	- multidimensional scaling (MDS)
		- Perceived in 2D primarily
		- scale, shrink, or rotate the data
		- Think of AER 301
	- locally linear embedding (LLE)
		- It is in 3D to optimize the 2d by projection making sure certain structure remain as is
	- isometric mapping (IsoMap)
  - Princiople it uses is to stretch
